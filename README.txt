Tucker Gordon and James Jelin
Project 1

What has been done so far:
-Cleaned data to be just the parts that we’re going to use
-Loaded data into js
-Built and ran function for creating a JSON object that can be used as the backend for the tree visualization (this is done once, and then saved in ‘treeData.js’
-Constructed the tree visualization based on the JSON object
-Constructed basic line graph
-Added toggle that adds two other lines to visualization with transition
-Added points to lines with tooltips that show up on hover
-Modularized all code (put code in functions to clean it up)
