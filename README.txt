-Cleaned data to be just the parts that we’re going to use
-Loaded data into js
-Built and ran function for creating a JSON object that can be used as the backend for the tree visualization (this is done once, and then saved in ‘treeData.js’
-Constructed the tree visualization based on the JSON object
