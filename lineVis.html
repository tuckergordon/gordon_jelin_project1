        <h3>How To Use:</h3>
        <p>
            There are three boxes you can toggle that allow you to get more detailed information about the data. The "Weekly Average" box one will start checked, and will display the average weekly alcohol consumption line.
            <br><br>
            If you check the "Weekend and weekday averages" box, two lines will appear: one for avg weekday alcohol consumption and one for weekend.
            <br><br>
            If you check the "Weekly averages based on parental situation" box, three lines appear. One for parents who are together, one for separated parents with female heads of household, and one for separated parents with a male head of household.
            <br><br>
            You can only select one box at a time. If you hover over a dot, you will see a pop up window that displays the specific average alcohol consumption for that point.
        </p>

        <!-- Tooltip that will be made visible and repositioned when points are hovered on -->
        <div id="tooltip" class="hidden"><p id="value"></p></div>
        <!-- Script for the visualization -->
        <script type="text/javascript" src="js/lineVis.js"></script>
        
        <div id="radioContainer">
        <!-- Radio buttons for selecting different lines to view
             Each button calls toggleLines, but the different ids allow the function
             to know which radio was selected. They all have the same name so that
             only one can be selected at a time. The class is for styling-->
