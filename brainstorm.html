		Dataset: <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/STUDENT+ALCOHOL+CONSUMPTION">
		Student Alcohol Consumption
		</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		(Note that this dataset is exclusively about Portuguese students ages 15-22)
	</p>
	<h3>Questions:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			How are drinking habits correlated with age, sex, and family size?
		</li>
		<li>
			What is the relationship between parents' education and student's alcohol use?
		</li>
		<li>
			What is the relationship between parents' occupations and student's alcohol use?
		</li>
		<li>
			What is the relationship between parents' marital status and their children's alcohol use?
		</li>
		<li>
			Does teen alcohol use change depending on the gender of the main household guardian (particularly in single-parent households)?
		</li>
		<li>
			Do youths drink less if they're involved in extracurriculars?
		</li>
		<li>
			How are grades affected by drinking on the weekend, drinking during the week, doing both, or not drinking at all? 
		</li>
		<li>
			Do urban students drink more or less than rural students?
		</li>
		<li>
			Do larger families contribute to youth drinking at all?
		</li>
		<li>
			For all of the above questions, are the effects different for men and women?
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Potential Interactive Systems:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			A line graph with age on the x-axis, and drinking amount on the y-axis. The graph will have two lines: 1 for male and 1 for female. There will be buttons below the graph that will allow you to apply filters (i.e. certain ages, sexes, family sizes), and watch how the lines change. This allows users to answer many of the above questions and get a better understanding of gender's relationship to drinking, all by using just one visualization.
		</li>
		<li>
			A stacked bar chart with, again, age on the x-axis and drinking amount on the y-axis. Each bar will have 5 pieces to it, one for each of the possible parental occupations that the data set affords. This will allow the user to see the total drinking amount for each age group, but also the amount of those totals that is associated with each parental occupation. There would be an option on the bottom to eliminate any occupation so you can only look at the others, or even look at just one at a time.
